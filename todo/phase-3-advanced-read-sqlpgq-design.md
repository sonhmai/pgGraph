# Phase 3 Design: Advanced Read GQL And SQL/PGQ Adapter

> Reminder: delete this tracking file before merging `feat/mutable-graph-projections` into `main`.

Phase 3 broadens the read surface once Phase 1 proves the shared read planner,
and adds SQL/PGQ as an **adapter** into the same IR (Q3). No new query-language
directory for SQL/PGQ — it lowers into `graph/src/query/`.

## 0. Entry conditions

- Phase 1 read planner stable; logical IR unchanged for any phase_1 row.
- IR frontend boundary confirmed neutral (no GQL-specific assumptions below
  `logical_plan.rs`).

## 1. Grammar additions (matrix `phase_3` rows)

```ebnf
query        = match_clause , { with_clause , [ match_clause ] } ,
               [ where_clause ] , return_clause , ... ;
match_clause = ( "OPTIONAL" )? , "MATCH" , pattern ;
with_clause  = "WITH" , [ "DISTINCT" ] , return_item , { "," , return_item } ,
               [ where_clause ] , [ order_by ] , [ skip ] , [ limit ] ;
return_item  = ( expr | aggregate | path_func ) , [ "AS" , alias ] ;
aggregate    = ( "count" | "sum" | "avg" | "min" | "max" | "collect" ) ,
               "(" , [ "DISTINCT" ] , ( expr | "*" ) , ")" ;
path_func    = ( "nodes" | "relationships" | "length" ) , "(" , path_var , ")" ;
```

Tokens added: `Optional`, `With`, plus aggregate/path-func names parsed as
`Ident` and resolved at bind time (not reserved keywords, to avoid clashing with
property names).

## 2. Binding scope chain (slice 3A — the enabling change)

`WITH` is the structural addition: it closes one variable scope and opens the
next. The binder becomes a **scope stack** instead of a single binding set.
Each `WITH`/`RETURN` projection defines the variables visible downstream;
`OPTIONAL MATCH` marks its pattern's new variables as nullable in the scope.
This is the largest Phase-3 design risk — build it first and prove it before the
feature rows below.

## 3. IR + physical operators activated here

Logical: `Optional` (left-outer over a pattern), `Aggregate { group_keys,
aggregations }`, `Distinct`, multi-stage `Project`, `Join`. Physical: `HashJoin`,
`NestedLoopBounded`, `AggregateRows` (beyond `count`), `DistinctRows`. `Optional`
lowers to a left-outer expand that null-extends unmatched rows.

## 4. JSONB type expansion (Q2 follow-through, slice 3F)

`jsonb`-backed dynamic/open properties, mixed-type lists, and maps arrive here.
Define the **missing-key vs explicit-`null`** rule for jsonb property bags
(distinct from the Phase-1 typed-column rule, where missing can't occur).
Typed columns keep the fast filter-index path; jsonb properties use
hydration-time evaluation. Update the canonical JSONB result shape doc with the
list/map encoding.

## 5. SQL/PGQ adapter (slice 3G)

When PostgreSQL exposes stable SQL/PGQ graph-table definitions or pattern hooks,
map eligible graph patterns to pgGraph projections by lowering into the shared
IR; unsupported SQL/PGQ stays PostgreSQL's responsibility. The adapter is a new
lowering entry into `graph/src/query/`, **not** a parser. A separate
compatibility matrix tracks SQL/PGQ coverage; unmappable patterns are rejected
with stable diagnostics.

Status, 2026-05-31: the internal typed SQL/PGQ adapter seam is implemented in
`graph/src/query/`. It accepts PostgreSQL-owned typed pattern shapes, lowers the
supported subset into the shared GQL AST/binder path, and keeps SQL text parsing
out of pgGraph. There is still no public SQL/PGQ API. Public exposure remains
blocked on stable PostgreSQL graph-pattern hooks.

### 5.1 SQL/PGQ Compatibility Matrix

| SQL/PGQ feature area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node pattern | supported | Typed adapter lowers a labeled node pattern into the shared node-scan IR. |
| Single relationship pattern | supported | Typed adapter lowers one labeled relationship pattern into the shared read IR. |
| Optional relationship pattern | supported | Maps to the same null-extension plan used by GQL `OPTIONAL MATCH`. |
| Projection and ordering | supported | Return items, aliases, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, and `LIMIT` lower through the shared binder. |
| Aggregates | supported | `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, and `collect` lower through the shared binder. |
| Predicates | deferred | Typed predicate lowering waits for stable PostgreSQL hook semantics. |
| `GRAPH_TABLE` SQL text | not_exposed | PostgreSQL owns SQL parsing; pgGraph exposes no SQL/PGQ parser or SQL API. |
| SQL/PGQ DDL | not_exposed | `CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH` and catalog ownership remain PostgreSQL concerns. |
| Multi-pattern joins | deferred | Requires the later multi-stage row-stream join planner before adapter exposure. |

## 6. PR slices (TDD order)

- **3A — `WITH` + scope chain.** Binder scope stack; multi-stage projection.
  Tests: variable visibility across stages, shadowing rules, scope-leak negatives.

  Status, 2026-05-31: projection-stage `WITH` is implemented for the current
  single-pattern executor. It supports aliases, shadowing, scalar property
  aliases, and leak-negative binding tests. `WITH ... MATCH ...` remains a
  later multi-pattern planner task because it requires row-stream joins rather
  than only scope rebinding.
- **3B — `OPTIONAL MATCH`.** Null-extension. Tests vs equivalent left-outer SQL.

  Status, 2026-05-31: top-level single-relationship `OPTIONAL MATCH` is
  implemented. Unmatched source rows and target-predicate misses return JSON
  `null` for target/relationship projections, and SQL tests compare the result
  shape against equivalent left-outer SQL. Node-only optional matches and
  post-`WITH` optional joins remain later multi-pattern planner work.
- **3C — Aggregates.** `count` (exists) → `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`/`collect`;
  grouping. Tests: correctness vs SQL aggregation, empty-group, null handling.

  Status, 2026-05-31: `RETURN` aggregates are implemented for node-only and
  single-relationship row streams. Non-aggregate return items are grouping keys;
  aggregate-only empty inputs return one output row; optional-match null rows
  participate in `count(*)` and are skipped by `count(expr)`, numeric
  aggregates, `min`, and `max`. Aggregate `WITH` projections and aggregate path
  arguments remain follow-up work for the later multi-stage planner.
- **3D — `DISTINCT`.** With memory limit (DR-2 style). Tests: dedup correctness,
  over-limit abort.

  Status, 2026-05-31: bounded `DISTINCT` is implemented for `RETURN DISTINCT`,
  `WITH DISTINCT` row-stream projection stages, and aggregate `DISTINCT` over
  the current read row streams. DISTINCT uses the GQL result cap as the
  unique-key memory cap and aborts on over-limit results. Remaining follow-up:
  aggregate `WITH` projections require a true multi-stage aggregation planner,
  and path arguments require the path value model from 3E.
- **3E — Path functions.** `nodes`/`relationships`/`length` over a stable path
  value model. Tests: path value-shape snapshots.

  Status, 2026-05-31: named relationship variables now have a stable path value
  model for bounded relationship patterns. `RETURN r` over a variable-length
  relationship returns `{"_path": {"nodes": [...], "relationships": [...]}}`;
  `nodes(r)`, `relationships(r)`, and `length(r)` are supported in final
  `RETURN` projections. Remaining follow-up: path-function `WITH` projections,
  full standalone path-variable syntax, and aggregate path arguments require the
  later multi-stage row-stream planner.
- **3F — jsonb properties.** Dynamic/list/map type mapping; missing-vs-null rule.

  Status, 2026-05-31: read-time JSONB property paths are implemented for
  registered dotted properties rooted at a `jsonb` source column. The executor
  evaluates those paths from hydrated source rows, preserves JSONB arrays and
  objects in `RETURN`, and treats missing keys as distinct from explicit JSON
  `null` for `IS NULL` predicates. Registration rejects dotted paths on
  non-JSONB base columns. JSONB path writes are intentionally deferred to the
  Phase 4 write-path slices.
- **3G — SQL/PGQ adapter.** Success + rejection corpus; own compatibility matrix.

  Status, 2026-05-31: closed for the internal typed adapter seam. The success
  corpus covers node-only reads, optional single-relationship reads,
  projections, aliases, path functions, aggregates, ordering, pagination, and
  `DISTINCT`. The rejection corpus covers out-of-matrix optional node-only
  patterns and invalid relationship ranges. The compatibility matrix above is
  the authoritative Phase 3G status; public SQL/PGQ exposure remains deferred.

Benchmark gate unchanged: existing CSR traversal must not regress.

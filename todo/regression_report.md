# Mutable Projection Regression Report

This report is appended after each performance-sensitive or memory-sensitive
change. It records the baseline used, regression commands, outcome, and
decision.

| Code changes | `#[cfg(test)]` projection modules only |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::` |
| Result | Passed; ignored contract tests remain out of the default suite |

| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until manifest loading affects engine status, reads, ingestion, or artifact publication |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 2 Atomic Manifest Publish And Load

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Manifest filesystem store, atomic publish, latest-generation load, temp-file ignore, and active-reference validation |
| Code changes | Projection manifest file I/O only; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::manifest`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Publish/load manifest tests, non-test compile, and doc references passed. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 534 passed, 5 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until manifests are loaded by engine status, reads, ingestion, cleanup, or repair paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 3 Complete Segment Format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Delta segment writer/loader, corruption validation, segment contract tests, and fuzz seeds |
| Code changes | Projection segment artifact codec under test/fuzz/development gates; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |

| Result | Segment tests passed, two segment contract tests turned green, fuzz package compiled with existing sync-helper dead-code warnings. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 542 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until segments are produced by ingestion or consumed by layered reads, compaction, cleanup, or repair paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 4 Mutation Normalization

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Committed mutation normalization, cancellation/delete precedence, bounded ingestion buffers, and normalized segment construction |
| Code changes | Projection normalization under test/development gates; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::normalize`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::segment`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cargo check --manifest-path graph/fuzz/Cargo.toml` |
| Result | Normalization tests and segment writer integration passed, including node/edge domain separation and deterministic duplicate-sync tie breaks. The fuzz package compiled with existing sync-helper dead-code warnings. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 553 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until normalized rows are produced by ingestion or consumed by live segment publication |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 5 Base-Only Engine Manifest Load

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Base-only projection manifest discovery during `.pggraph` load and backend-local status metadata |
| Code changes | Persistence load path and engine status metadata only; CSR remains the active read path |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 persistence::tests::`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Persistence/load-path tests passed, including base-only manifest load, CSR traversal preservation, base manifest status metadata, wrong-base rejection, stale checksum rejection, wrong-version rejection, and non-base-only rejection. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 560 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because traversal, GQL, components, shortest-path, ingestion, compaction, GC, and SQL read-path adoption are unchanged |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 6 Core Ingestion Publisher

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Testable committed-row ingestion into L0 projection segments and next-manifest publication |
| Code changes | Projection ingestion under test/development gates; no SQL entrypoint, scheduler wiring, traversal read-path adoption, compaction, or GC change yet |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Core ingestion tests passed, including committed filtering, aborted-row exclusion, watermark rollback on failed publish, artifact-root publication locking, serialized generations, generation-overflow rejection, node-surface normalization and limits, durable no-overwrite segment publication, edge weights, node state, resolution, filter, tenant, and direction-specific edge segments. Check, doctests, and docs passed. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 567 passed, 2 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until ingestion is wired into SQL/scheduled maintenance or durable segments are consumed by runtime read paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 6 SQL Projection Ingestion

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | SQL `graph.ingest_projection(...)`, committed sync-log conversion, persisted-base manifest publication, and scheduled-maintenance ingestion call |
| Code changes | Production-visible projection ingestion modules; artifact checksum/version helpers; tombstone-safe resolution lookup; sync-log conversion into edge/node/resolution/filter/tenant projection rows; pgrx SQL wrapper; scheduled maintenance invokes ingestion after `apply_sync_internal()` and ignores missing persisted base artifacts |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest -- --list`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 ingest_projection`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 scheduled_maintenance`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | Unit loader smoke and core ingestion tests passed. The pgrx SQL signature, persisted sync-log ingestion, base-checkpoint watermark, and no-row watermark-advance tests passed, and scheduled maintenance still applies sync/starts maintenance while treating absent persisted projection artifacts as a no-op. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 567 passed, 2 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because runtime traversal, GQL, components, shortest-path, compaction, GC, and durable read-path adoption are unchanged; record this as an artifact-write-path checkpoint |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 7 Layered Runtime

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Pure layered neighbor runtime over base CSR, durable segments, and transaction-local deltas |
| Code changes | Added production-visible `projection/layered.rs`, an owned neighbor iterator variant, durable segment-provider boundary, deterministic durable insert/delete/weight merging, node visibility and tenant-membership filtering, and weighted-neighbor lookup |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::layered`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::neighbors`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py`; `git diff --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | Layered, neighbor, compile, doctest, docs, and whitespace gates passed. Feature contracts are intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 5 passed, 1 failed. Full unit tests are expected-red with 580 passed, 1 failed future status/diagnostics contract, and 1 ignored scale test. Independent-review findings were fixed before promotion: tx node tombstones, tx weighted inserts, manifest checksum checks, and real-provider/proptest coverage. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required in this checkpoint because Engine and SQL read paths still use the existing CSR/overlay selection; run read-latency and BFS comparisons in Microphase 8 when layered reads become query-visible |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 8 SQL Read-Path Adoption

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Public traversal, shortest path, weighted shortest path, connected components, and GQL relationship expansion select layered neighbors for segment-backed manifests |
| Code changes | Engine read-path selection now builds manifest-backed `LayeredNeighbors`; segment-backed `.pggraph` reloads activate mutable-overlay reads; base-only and `csr_readonly` manifests keep the CSR fast path; committed `Engine.edge_buffer` overlays remain visible inside layered reads; inbound layered base reads use the reverse CSR store; BFS keeps its concrete overlay hot path and exposes a separate generic helper for layered callers |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo bench --features pg17 --bench bfs_bench -- --baseline pre_durable_projection`; targeted follow-ups: `d1_supernode/500k`, `d1_supernode/2M_panama`, and `d3_leaf/2M_panama` |
| Result | Full comparison completed. Existing mutable-overlay guardrail improved: `no_overlay_d3` -4.94%, `sparse_overlay_d3` -6.08%, `dense_overlay_d3` -2.81%. Filter traversal improved: sparse -6.23%, dense -2.67%. Several deeper raw BFS cases improved. A first `d1_supernode/500k` regression was reduced to no-change after restoring the concrete BFS hot path (`+0.95%`, p = 0.23). Residual targeted raw-BFS regressions remain on the 2M Panama fixture: `d1_supernode/2M_panama` +4.07% and `d3_leaf/2M_panama` +6.33%. |
| Decision | Promote the Microphase 8 checkpoint with the residual 2M raw-BFS regressions recorded for follow-up because the directly relevant existing overlay guardrail improved and segment-backed layered SQL reads now pass pgrx correctness gates. Segment files are still decoded per read and should be cached or otherwise benchmarked before release. Do not treat this as a release-ready performance signoff; Microphase 12 must add durable segment-specific BFS, weighted, and GQL benchmarks before production replacement. |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 9 Base Chunk Rewrite

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Base chunk manifest metadata, checked chunk rewrite publication, targeted corrupt-chunk repair, and layered base-range replacement semantics |
| Code changes | Added `projection::chunk` for source-range chunk publication and repair; added dirty source/edge counters to `ManifestChunkRef`; manifest-backed layered reads now load base chunks, replace covered outgoing base ranges, suppress covered inbound base edges, and merge chunk inbound edges |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 base_chunk_`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::manifest`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::layered`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts` |
| Result | Base chunk manifest, rewrite equivalence, old-generation readability, partial-overlap expansion, unchanged-edge preservation, malformed inbound chunk rejection, and corruption repair tests passed. Manifest and layered tests passed. Feature contracts remain intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 5 passed, 1 failed. |
| Decision | No new benchmark comparison required for this checkpoint because chunk rewrite is a publication/repair boundary and only affects manifests that already opt into chunked generations. Default CSR/base-only reads and existing SQL read-path selection are unchanged; benchmark chunked generation reads when compaction or repair scheduling makes chunks operationally active. |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 10 Compaction

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Durable segment fanout compaction, tombstone-preserving merged segments, dirty chunk pressure rewrite, and bounded publication failure |
| Code changes | Added `projection::compact`; L0 segments compact to L1, L1 segments compact to L2, compacted output is derived from the previous layered view against base CSR, high segment pressure can publish base chunks instead, non-edge segments and durable weights are retained, overlapping dirty ranges are normalized, and budget failures leave the previous manifest current |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::compact`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 compaction_`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 base_chunk_`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::layered`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | L0-to-L1, L1-to-L2, tombstone precedence, non-edge segment retention, weighted edge retention, dirty chunk pressure, dirty chunk weight/non-edge retention, overlapping dirty-range normalization, and interruption tests passed. Chunk, layered, compile, format, doctest, and docs gates passed. Full tests remain intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 608 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required for this checkpoint because compaction is not yet invoked by SQL or scheduled maintenance. It creates opt-in compacted artifacts that preserve layered output; measure when compaction is connected to an operational maintenance path. |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 11 Active Generation Heartbeat

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Active backend generation liveness rows, stale heartbeat expiry, GC-facing active-generation predicate, and SQL active generation count |
| Code changes | SQL heartbeat helpers now record/refresh backend PID, database OID, generation, heartbeat/expiry timestamps, sync watermark, and validation status; manifest installation records the current backend heartbeat immediately; status refresh expires stale rows and refreshes the installed manifest heartbeat; `graph.active_generation_count()` exposes the active count without changing the existing `graph.status()` row ABI |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::manifest`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 projection_generation_heartbeat`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 projection_mode_build_and_status_contract`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 sync_health_exposes_operator_contract_field_names`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | Manifest heartbeat unit tests passed. Pgrx heartbeat tests passed for manifest-install record/status exposure, refresh/upsert, stale expiry, and GC active-generation blocking. Projection-mode status and sync-health signature contracts passed with existing ABIs preserved. Full tests remain intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 608 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because this checkpoint changes SQL metadata and status paths, not graph traversal/read-path execution. Keep the existing `graph.status()` ABI intact and expose active generation count through a new scalar status helper because pgrx rejects a wider status tuple. |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 12 Generation-Aware GC

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Metadata-only projection artifact cleanup, retained-generation protection, active-heartbeat protection, idempotent obsolete-file deletion, and SQL GC summary exposure |
| Code changes | Added `projection::gc`; GC scans valid manifest metadata, protects references from the newest retained generations and active heartbeat generations, fails closed when an active generation has no valid manifest, deletes only manifest-declared obsolete files, ignores already-missing candidates, adds `graph.projection_retention_generations`, and exposes `graph.projection_gc()` |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::gc`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 projection_gc`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 guc_contract_defaults_ranges_and_contexts_are_registered`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 projection_generation_heartbeat`; `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | GC refusal, active-generation protection, unmatched-active fail-closed behavior, retention-based deletion, idempotence, crash-shape, compile, SQL deletion/idempotence/signature, GUC range/default, heartbeat, format, doctest, and docs-reference tests passed. Full tests remain intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 613 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required at this checkpoint because GC does not alter traversal/read-path execution; it scans manifest metadata and removes only obsolete files. Revisit latency benchmarks when scheduled maintenance invokes GC automatically. |

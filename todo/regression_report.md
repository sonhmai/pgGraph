# Mutable Projection Regression Report

This report is appended after each performance-sensitive or memory-sensitive
change. It records the baseline used, regression commands, outcome, and
decision.

## 2026-06-07: Initial Planning Baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Planning documentation and initial benchmark baseline |
| Code changes | None |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo bench --features pg17 --bench bfs_bench -- --save-baseline pre_durable_projection` |
| Result | Baseline captured successfully |
| Decision | Use `pre_durable_projection` as the comparison baseline until a phase-specific baseline is recorded |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 0 Test Harness

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Test-only fixture helpers and ignored durable-projection contract tests |
| Code changes | `#[cfg(test)]` projection modules only |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::` |
| Result | Passed; ignored contract tests remain out of the default suite |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because no runtime, memory, traversal, SQL, or artifact production code changed |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 1 Manifest And Generation Table

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Manifest JSON model, active-generation heartbeat helpers, generation metadata table, and public sync docs |
| Code changes | Pure manifest metadata plus SQL bootstrap; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::manifest`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Manifest tests, non-test compile, and doc references passed. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 528 passed, 5 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until manifest loading affects engine status, reads, ingestion, or artifact publication |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 2 Atomic Manifest Publish And Load

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Manifest filesystem store, atomic publish, latest-generation load, temp-file ignore, and active-reference validation |
| Code changes | Projection manifest file I/O only; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::manifest`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Publish/load manifest tests, non-test compile, and doc references passed. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 534 passed, 5 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until manifests are loaded by engine status, reads, ingestion, cleanup, or repair paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 3 Complete Segment Format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Delta segment writer/loader, corruption validation, segment contract tests, and fuzz seeds |
| Code changes | Projection segment artifact codec under test/fuzz/development gates; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::segment`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cargo check --manifest-path graph/fuzz/Cargo.toml` |
| Result | Segment tests passed, two segment contract tests turned green, fuzz package compiled with existing sync-helper dead-code warnings. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 542 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until segments are produced by ingestion or consumed by layered reads, compaction, cleanup, or repair paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 4 Mutation Normalization

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Committed mutation normalization, cancellation/delete precedence, bounded ingestion buffers, and normalized segment construction |
| Code changes | Projection normalization under test/development gates; no traversal/read-path runtime adoption |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::normalize`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::segment`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cargo check --manifest-path graph/fuzz/Cargo.toml` |
| Result | Normalization tests and segment writer integration passed, including node/edge domain separation and deterministic duplicate-sync tie breaks. The fuzz package compiled with existing sync-helper dead-code warnings. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 553 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until normalized rows are produced by ingestion or consumed by live segment publication |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 5 Base-Only Engine Manifest Load

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Base-only projection manifest discovery during `.pggraph` load and backend-local status metadata |
| Code changes | Persistence load path and engine status metadata only; CSR remains the active read path |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 persistence::tests::`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Persistence/load-path tests passed, including base-only manifest load, CSR traversal preservation, base manifest status metadata, wrong-base rejection, stale checksum rejection, wrong-version rejection, and non-base-only rejection. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 560 passed, 3 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because traversal, GQL, components, shortest-path, ingestion, compaction, GC, and SQL read-path adoption are unchanged |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 6 Core Ingestion Publisher

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Testable committed-row ingestion into L0 projection segments and next-manifest publication |
| Code changes | Projection ingestion under test/development gates; no SQL entrypoint, scheduler wiring, traversal read-path adoption, compaction, or GC change yet |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py` |
| Result | Core ingestion tests passed, including committed filtering, aborted-row exclusion, watermark rollback on failed publish, artifact-root publication locking, serialized generations, generation-overflow rejection, node-surface normalization and limits, durable no-overwrite segment publication, edge weights, node state, resolution, filter, tenant, and direction-specific edge segments. Check, doctests, and docs passed. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 567 passed, 2 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required until ingestion is wired into SQL/scheduled maintenance or durable segments are consumed by runtime read paths |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 6 SQL Projection Ingestion

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | SQL `graph.ingest_projection(...)`, committed sync-log conversion, persisted-base manifest publication, and scheduled-maintenance ingestion call |
| Code changes | Production-visible projection ingestion modules; artifact checksum/version helpers; tombstone-safe resolution lookup; sync-log conversion into edge/node/resolution/filter/tenant projection rows; pgrx SQL wrapper; scheduled maintenance invokes ingestion after `apply_sync_internal()` and ignores missing persisted base artifacts |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest -- --list`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::ingest`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 ingest_projection`; `cd graph && cargo pgrx test --features "pg17 development" pg17 scheduled_maintenance`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | Unit loader smoke and core ingestion tests passed. The pgrx SQL signature, persisted sync-log ingestion, base-checkpoint watermark, and no-row watermark-advance tests passed, and scheduled maintenance still applies sync/starts maintenance while treating absent persisted projection artifacts as a no-op. Full `cargo test --features pg17` is intentionally red with 567 passed, 2 future durable-projection contract failures, and 1 ignored scale test. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required because runtime traversal, GQL, components, shortest-path, compaction, GC, and durable read-path adoption are unchanged; record this as an artifact-write-path checkpoint |

## 2026-06-07: Microphase 7 Layered Runtime

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | Pure layered neighbor runtime over base CSR, durable segments, and transaction-local deltas |
| Code changes | Added production-visible `projection/layered.rs`, an owned neighbor iterator variant, durable segment-provider boundary, deterministic durable insert/delete/weight merging, node visibility and tenant-membership filtering, and weighted-neighbor lookup |
| Baseline | `todo/measurements.md`, Criterion baseline `pre_durable_projection` |
| Command | `cd graph && cargo fmt --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::layered`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::neighbors`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 projection::test_contracts`; `cd graph && cargo check --features pg17`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17 --doc`; `python3 scripts/check_doc_references.py`; `git diff --check`; `cd graph && cargo test --features pg17` |
| Result | Layered, neighbor, compile, doctest, docs, and whitespace gates passed. Feature contracts are intentionally red only for the future status/diagnostics contract: 5 passed, 1 failed. Full unit tests are expected-red with 580 passed, 1 failed future status/diagnostics contract, and 1 ignored scale test. Independent-review findings were fixed before promotion: tx node tombstones, tx weighted inserts, manifest checksum checks, and real-provider/proptest coverage. |
| Decision | No benchmark comparison required in this checkpoint because Engine and SQL read paths still use the existing CSR/overlay selection; run read-latency and BFS comparisons in Microphase 8 when layered reads become query-visible |
